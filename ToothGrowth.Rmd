Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

```{r LoadAndExplore}
# Make sure that the data is available and then convert it to a tibble for easier handling.
require(datasets)
data <- ToothGrowth

summary(data)
```


Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
Provide a basic summary of the data.

Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
